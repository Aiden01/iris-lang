# Iris-lang

A simple programing language for my own learning

## Syntax example

```
fn f (a: Int, b: Int): Int  {
    return a + b;
}

val x = add(1, 2);
print(x);

```

## Features
- Algebraic data types
- High order functions
- Type inference 

## Roadmap
- [x] Parser
- [x] Interpreter
- [ ] Type system

## Why?

I decided to make this because I wanted to learn about how programing languages are designed and how parsing works. Note that I don't expect anyone to use it, this is just for my own learning.
