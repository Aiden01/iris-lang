# Iris-lang

A simple programing language for my own learning

## Syntax example

```
val obj = {
    j: 4,
    foo: 7
};

fn f (a: Int, b: Int)  {
    return a + b;
}
```

## Why?

I decided to make this because I wanted to learn about how programing languages are designed and how parsing works. Note that I don't expect anyone to use it, this is just for my own learning.
